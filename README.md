# What is this repo
This repo contains a compiled web-app used to teach https://github.com/csunibo/informatica-teorica

The web-app accepts a YAML description of a turing machine and executes it, see linked website for further information


# NOTE

After some research I discovered that the file given by the professor is a translated version of https://github.com/aepsilon/turing-machine-viz.
So check that repository for the original version.
